This module does involve you learning the basics of yet another programming languages, do I really expect you to be able to learn a third new programming language this year?  

Yes I do.  

But, in the words of Douglas Adams, [Don't Panic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).  

Programming consists of a number of different skills.  
* Breaking a problem in to a number of smaller and smaller problems  
* Working out the logic of solving those small problems  
* Turning that logic in to code  

The first two skills are (mostly) language independent, the processes are the same regardless of which programming language you use. (This is a simplification. OOP and structured programming do break down the problem in different ways. Programming languages all have specialisations that make some tasks easier and others harder. In general though the point is mostly correct)  

The third skill, turning language in to code, is obviously language specific. However for most programming languages that code is very similar - 'if ()' statements all look kinda similar, 'for()' loops vary a little more but are easily recognisable. Once you know one language it is easier and faster to learn another.

### Python Programming Language

Python is very similar to Java. It has a few oddities of its own but is, overall, much like Java. You will pick it up quickly and 
easily. Python is often used as a scripting language. There are many free libraries out there and we will be using Pygame, a library designed for making games.


### Programming

Please remember, programming is a **knowledge** and a **skill**. I can provide you with information in the form of lectures, tutorials and point you at books to help you learn the **knowledge** but the **skill** comes from practice. The **skill** only comes from writing code.
