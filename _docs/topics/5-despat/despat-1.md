Design Patterns have a somewhat standardised structure to make working with them easier. However variation does occur between different sources.  

## Name
Every pattern has a name, usually one that expresses its purpose in a nutshell. This name is used in documentation or in communication as a shorthand for the approach the pattern describes.
## Intent
Intent is usually a short statement(s) that captures the essence of the pattern being discussed, it states what the pattern does. Be warned though many pattern write ups use terse academic language. The short statement of intent may not be a simple or easy to understand description.  
## Also Known As
Other names for the pattern.
## Problem/Motivation
Under the problem heading is a description of the situation the pattern is designed to be a solution to. This should be used to help come to a decision as to whether a specific design pattern is appropriate to the situation you are looking for a solution to. It may take the form of a hypothetical problem requiring a solution.
## Solution
The Solution is a high level description of how the design pattern provides a solution to the problem.
## Structure
The structure is a graphical representation of the solution, typically as UML class and interaction diagrams.
## Participants
A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.  
## Collaboration
A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other.
## Consequences
A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern. This covers both positive and negative consequences. 
## Implementation
A description of an implementation of the pattern; the actual solution part of the pattern.
## Sample Code
An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language. Note that this is not a generic, drag and drop code solution, it is an example of how the pattern can be used for a specific version of the problem. 
## Known Uses
Examples of real usages of the pattern.
## Related Patterns
Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.
