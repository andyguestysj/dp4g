I've coded up a very basic, very simple version of the Prisoner's Dilemma

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma

#### Exercise 1 

1. Log in to repl.it
2. Go to [https://repl.it/@andyguest/pyPrisonersDilemma](https://repl.it/@andyguest/pyPrisonersDilemma)
3. Click on the `fork` button at the top of the window to make a copy of the code in your own repls
4. Click on the three lines at the top left of the window and then `My Repls` in the pop out menu
5. Open the `pyPrisonersDilemma` repl from your area

Try implementing more strategies and see how they do.
