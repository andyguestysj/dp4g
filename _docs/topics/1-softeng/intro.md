4. UML

This topic section is a review of traditional and software engineering, of the iterative approach to software development and design, of object-oriented analysis and design and UML. This should serve as a review of topics covered in Programming 01 and 02, and in Software Engineering.  

We are reviewing these topics because Design Patterns are based on good object oriented software development practices and students require a good grounding in those practices to fully understand them.  

As with everything to do with software development, the knowledge of these subjects is only the start. You will only really understand design patterns and how effective they can be if you practice using them.
