## Background

We've already covered some of the problems that can arise when using the Waterfall Model. Projects can get bogged down because of documentation, because too much time is spent on documentation or, ironically, not enough time is spent on it.  

The computing industry, hardware and software, advanced rapidly. Software requirements often had to change at short notice, tools and libraries were constantly changing. The Waterfall Model struggled to keep up. Something more flexible was required for many projects.  

There was also the programmers to consider. Programmers like to code, they like the challenge of it. They don't, in general, like spending most of their time reading and writing documentation. They resent the coding part of their job being treated as the smallest, least significant part of the project. They wanted a way to run projects that suited them, something more flexible, less formal, and something with less documentation.  

## The Agile Manifesto

In 2001 the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) was created by a group of experienced software developers. This manifesto is a description of their beliefs about how software projects should be managed, how software should be created. It wasn't a step by step guide to project management, instead it detailed a series of principles that should guide software development.  

The key principles are :-  
  * **Individuals and interactions** over process and tools
  * **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
  * **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
  * **Responding to change** over following a plan

### **Individuals and interactions** over process and tools
Under the Waterfall Model the process is all important. If an programmer sees a better way of doing something than is described in the documentation then either the documentation must be updated (a long process) or the better way has to be ignored. If processes and tools are the key way that a project is managed then people have to change the way they work to match the tools.  

If instead we focus on people over process their energy and skills are focused on solving problems rather than on how the process dictates they should approach solving the problem.

### **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
Project progress should be measured in terms of working software, not progress through a process which is documentation heavy.

### **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
Software requirements change constantly. Under such circumstances a contract that specifies exactly what is required will be out of date quickly and all changes will require the contract to be changed. Contracts cannot be changed without negotiation and typically all involved will be trying to get the best outcome for themselves.  
Agile values working with customers, viewing the process as a collaboration between developers and customers.

### **Responding to change** over following a plan
Changes are inevitable in software development. Requirements are missed or misunderstood early on. Better approaches are discovered during coding. Customers identify changes and improvements when they interact with prototypes. Developers spot improvements and connections when working with the data. A plan is never complete and slavishly sticking to a plan will lead to inferior if not flawed software.  

Agile values responding to changes in a flexible manner.

## "Generic Agile" Approach

### Common Features In Agile Methodologies
* Break down code in to small features
* Work on one feature at a time 
* Work in short sprints
* Work iteratively
* Regularly review feature/work list
* Always have a working build

### Iterative Approach
The structure of the software developement process is familiar but instead of applying to project as a whole it applies to small parts of the project. 

![Development Cycle](/assets/img/iter.png "Developement Cycle")

The development process is iterative and repeated over and over again during the project.

### Feature List
Software is not fully designed at the start. Instead a list of desired features is created. New features may be added to the list at any time. The list is re-prioritised after every sprint.

### Sprints
Work is carried out in short sprints, where each sprint is focus on specific functionality to be implemented.

### Always have a working build
Having working software is not something that should be left till the end when all the completed components are integrated together. In Agile projects there should always be a working build of the software. Initially it will contain very few features but as each sprint is completed the output of that sprint should be added in to the working build. Ideally this process is automated. All features should be written in such a way that later updates do not break any previously working features.  

## Many Approaches
The Agile Manifesto describes principles and values that should lead project management. It doesn't describe how to implement those principles in procedures. You cannot follow *The Agile Methodology* because there is no such thing. There are a number of Agile Methodologies each inspired by the manifesto. The methodologies have much in common but each is different.

### Common methodologies
* Agile Scrumm Methodology
* Lean Software Development
* Kanban
* Extreme Programming (XP)
* Crystal
* Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM)
* Feature Driven Development (FDD)

**Scrum** Instead of a large group spending a long time building a big thing, we have a small team, spending a short time building a small thing, but integrating regularly to see the whole.

**Kanban** is a highly visual method of managing workflow. Kanban is a very light weight agile approach, with few processes.

**Extreme Programming** (XP) is focused on speed and continuous delivery. Sprints are shorter. XP is a heavier framework (though still pretty light one).
