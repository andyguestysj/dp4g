## Software Engineering

According to Wikipedia  
``` Software engineering (SE) is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software ```

Software can get very complex very quickly. It is hard for one person to keep track when developing a large application, when more than one person is working on it it becomes almost impossible. We need a methodology, a sensible approach that ensures everything is done correctly, on time and on budget.  

Early software developers took inspiration from the engineering disciplines where projects are planned out, documented in advance with targets and deadlines and work packaged in to parcels so individual engineers could work on small parts of the project in isolation. This approach was applied to developing software, hence software engineering, to try to manage projects and turn ramshackle ad-hoc software hacking in to a predictable, controllable process.  

This approach has met with mixed success. Sometimes it works well, sometimes it fails miserably.  

Along the way some software developers decided that a different approach might be better. An approach that suited how they liked to work, something more flexible. They came up with the Agile Manifesto, a set of principles on how to approach software development. From this manifesto a number of Agile methodologies were developed. 

Traditional software engineering is still very much in use though. There are circumstances where it is a better approach than an Agile one.
