## Software Engineering

According to Wikipedia  
``` Software engineering (SE) is the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, and the study of these approaches; that is, the application of engineering to software ```

Software can get very complex very quickly. It is hard for one person to keep track when developing a large application, when more than one person is working on it it becomes almost impossible. We need a methodology, a sensible approach that ensures everything is done correctly, on time and on budget.  

Early software developers took inspiration from the engineering disciplines where projects are planned out, documented in advance with targets and deadlines and work packaged in to parcels so individual engineers could work on small parts of the project in isolation. This approach was applied to developing software, hence software engineering, to try to manage projects and turn ramshackle ad-hoc software hacking in to a predictable, controllable process.  

This approach has met with mixed success. Sometimes it works well, sometimes it fails miserably.  

Along the way some software developers decided that a different approach might be better. An approach that suited how they liked to work, something more flexible. They came up with the Agile Manifesto, a set of principles on how to approach software development. From this manifesto a number of Agile methodologies were developed. 

Traditional software engineering is still very much in use though. There are circumstances where it is a better approach than an Agile one.

## Traditional or Structured Engineering

Traditional, or structured, engineering, is an approach to managing engineering projects that focuses on preparation and planning before action.  

Simply put, the traditional engineering approach is to consider and document every aspect of a project before any other work takes place. With all the information known it is then possible to plan the project, knowing every action that needs to be taken and when. This allows work to be broken down in to smaller tasks that can be carried out independantly of each other and which can be scheduled so that all pre-requisites are carried out in time to complete every task.  

In civil engineering, as an example, extensive investigation is carried out and documented before building work begins. Everything from the ground conditions, local laws and regulations, weather, population, traffic is documented along side the customers requirements for the building - the number of occupants, office space, power, water, etc. Using this documentation every phase of the building process is planned and scheduled. The foundations need to be laid first but this needs to be coordinated with any underground water, waste and electrical installations. The building frame needs to go up followed by the walls, roofing, windows and doors. Internal walls need coordinating with the installation of electrical wiring and water pipes. And so on.  

The careful documentation and planning allows every task to be identified and scheduled. It enables the creation of work packages detailing individual tasks so that particular workers know everything they need to know about specific tasks.  

If everything goes to plan the building will be completed on time, on budget and to specification. Things doen't always go to plan of course, delays can and do occur, but they occur in known ways and the documentation and plans contain contingency plans to handle many problems and delays. Extra and spare time can be built in to timetables to allow for unexpected, but forseeable, delays.  

## Structured approach to software development

How does this work in software development? It is usually illustrated using the Waterfall Model.
