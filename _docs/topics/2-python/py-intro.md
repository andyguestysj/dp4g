Python is an interpreted, high-level, general purpose programming language. It is designed to be very readable and there are many freely available libraries.  

It is Widely used by :- 
* academics for rapid prototyping, data manipulation
* games as a scripting language

## Features

Python's features include −  
* **Easy-to-learn** − Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.
* **Easy-to-read** − Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.
* **Easy-to-maintain** − Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.
* **A broad standard library** − Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.
* **Interactive Mode** − Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.
* **Portable** − Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.
* **Extendable** − You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.
* **Databases** − Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.
* **GUI Programming** − Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.
* **Scalable** − Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.

Apart from the above-mentioned features, Python has a big list of good features, few are listed below −  
* It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.
* It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.
* It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.
* It supports automatic garbage collection.
* It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.

## Installing Python
We'll be using Visual Studio Code to work with Python. Instructions for setting up VSC are later in this section.
If you want to install Python locally you can get it from [www.python.org](www.python.org).
