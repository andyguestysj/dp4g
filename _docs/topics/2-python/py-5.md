#### Exercise 1 - Morse Code Generator

1. Log in to repl.it
2. Create a new repl. Make it a Python program and call it `py_morse_code`
3. Write an application that reads in a string of text from the keyboard and converts it to morse code, outputting one the morse for each character on a separate line. The test should consist of only lower case characters and spaces.

Yes this is the same exercise from this week's Programming 03 session. It should highlight how much easier a modern language like Python is to use and how well suited Python is to this kind of task.  

#### Exercise 2

1. Log in to repl.it
2. Go to [https://repl.it/@andyguest/pyWordTask](https://repl.it/@andyguest/pyWordTask)
3. Click on the `fork` button at the top of the window to make a copy of the code in your own repls
4. Click on the three lines at the top left of the window and then `My Repls` in the pop out menu
5. Open the `pyWordTask` repl from your area
6. Work your way through the tasks in the code - they are in the comments

You will need the following Python functions  
To open and read from  a file [open](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_file_handling.asp)  
To split a string in to parts [split](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_split.asp)
