Begin with the declaration -  
>“Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”

**Identify**
1. What went well
2. What didn't go so well
3. Ideas for improvement
4. Shout-outs for team members who did something exceptional


## Sprint Planning

[Web page on Sprints, planning near top](https://ysjdp.netlify.app/docs/agile-2/)

### Actions
1. **Set Sprint Goal** - set a goal for the sprint. The goal should thematically describe the nature of the software being created - game core, character basics, physics, etc.
2. **Identify Features For Sprint** - you should have a product backlog sorted by importance. Now you need to identify which features to include in the sprint. 
3. **Record the Task Board** - take a screen shot of your task board at this point for your final report. 


## Identify Features For The Sprint

This may be a number of features from the top of the backlog or they may be chosen because of the goal. Be realistic about what you can achieve in a week. Don't agree to more than you think is possible. At the same time don't do too little, you want to get the project finished so you'll need to do the work! Features chosen should be moved from the **product backlog** to the **sprint backlog**.   

You may wish to subdivide chosen features down further in to tasks. Team members might work on entire features or just some of the tasks that make it up. 

Ensure every feature and task in the sprint is assigned to a team member and every team member knows exactly which tasks they are working on.
