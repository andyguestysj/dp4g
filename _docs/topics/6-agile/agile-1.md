A product backlog is a prioritized list of work for the development team that is derived from the roadmap and its requirements. The most important items are shown at the top of the product backlog so the team knows what to deliver first.  

The **Product Backlog** is a decision-making artifact that helps you estimate, refine, and prioritize everything you might sometime in the future want to complete.  It helps ensure the team is working on the most important and valuable features, fixing the most important bugs, or doing other important work critical to product development.  

The backlog, therefore, is tremendously useful in situations when you are unable to do everything being asked (so, most situations), or in contexts when even a small amount of planning will help a lot (so, in most contexts).  

Many think of this backlog as a to-do list, and define it in exactly this way, as a list of things you must do to deliver your product to market. In truth, it is not necessarily a to-do list. Think of it as a wish list.  

## Backlog Item Categories

Four main categories of items (called product backlog items) fit in the product backlog. Two are highly visible to customers — features and bugs. The other two, technical debt and research, are invisible to customers yet can't be ignored.  

In an Agile organization, product backlog items are typically written as user stories — though they don’t always need to be. They can also be written as traditional requirements documents, or in a number of other ways.  

When written as user stories, product backlog items often take the following form:

>As a <stakeholder>, I want <action> so that <benefit>.

### New Features

Requests for new features originate from a multitude of sources. These include end users, sales, support, product management, and so on. New features can be the most difficult to prioritize as you try to balance the competing needs of:
* Keeping existing customers satisfied.
* Meeting near-term sales opportunities.
* Working toward a longer-term vision of your product.
The product owner should monitor these sources routinely and resolve any conflicting requests. Doing so will help make sure the backlog contains new features that both attract new customers and build loyalty with existing ones.  

> As a <new feature>, I want <to be understood and prioritized appropriately> so that <I can deliver maximum value to customers and owners>.
