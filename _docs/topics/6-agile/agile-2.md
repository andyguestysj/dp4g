## What Is A Sprint?
As described in the Scrum Guide, a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, useable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created. Sprints have consistent durations throughout a development effort. A new Sprint starts immediately after the conclusion of the previous Sprint.  

During the Sprint:
* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
* Quality goals do not decrease; and,
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Each Sprint may be considered a project with no more than a one-month horizon. Like projects, Sprints are used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has a goal of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product increment.  

Sprints are limited to one calendar month. When a Sprint’s horizon is too long the definition of what is being built may change, complexity may rise, and risk may increase. Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to one calendar month of cost.  


## Sprint In Action

### Day One

The Sprint starts with the whole team meeting for for a Sprint Planning session.

#### Sprint Planning

In preparation the Product Backlog should be organised, ensuring features have estimates and acceptance criteria. The Backlog should be ordered by importance.  
A *Sprint Goal* should be agreed. The selection of work should be features that are related. The goal might be a single coherent feature or a significant risk being mitigated. A good goal helps the team focus.  

#### Sprint Backlog Selection

Next the work should be planned. Items from the Product Backlog are selected based on the *sprint goal*. Technical tasks required to implement each item selected are identified, planned and scheduled.

</centre>

By the end of Sprint Planning, a team should be confident that it has made a good forecast of the work that will be needed to meet the Sprint Goal. It will have captured that plan in the Sprint Backlog which the team wholly owns. The team should be able to begin implementing that plan immediately and with a clear understanding – such as a *Sprint Burndown* - of how much work remains at any given point.

Now the **Scrum Task Board** can be setup.

Features chosen for the Sprint are moved from the Product Backlog column to the Sprint Backlog. Any technical tasks identified are added alongside the selected features.

### Every Day

#### Daily Scrum
Every day during the Sprint a Daily Scrum meeting is held. The entire development team get together for no more than fifteen minutes. These meetings are often held standing up to help ensure they are kept to the point and as brief as possible. During the meeting each team member should identify  
* What they did yesterday to help the team meet the Sprint Goal
* What they intend to do today to help the team meet the Sprint Goal
* Any impediments which are getting in their way
The Daily Scrum is *not the place to respond* to any issues raised, those discussions should take place after the meeting. The purpose of the Daily Scrum is help everyone focus and be aware of the sprint progress.  

#### Product Backlog Refinement
The Product backlog should be refined regularly. This might be half an hour daily or an hour or two twice a week. A refinement session begins with the Product Owner presenting the current Product Backlog to the team. The team start at the top of the backlog and work their way down the list, refining each feature in turn. (Planning Poker may be used here). 

#### Collaborative Working

In agile practice, team members never work in isolation – if they did, they wouldn’t be a team.  
Examples of collaboration include:  
* Helping peers to complete work in progress before bringing in new work from a backlog
* Pair programming, such as taking it in turns to use the keyboard and helping and checking each other’s work
* Peer review
* Asking for help, and being keen to give it
* Going to where the work is and helping, instead of waiting for work to be passed over to them
* Making sure that all work does in fact meet the Definition of Done
* Calling a Scrum in order to resolve problems which need the team’s immediate attention
* Raising impediments to the Scrum Master so they can be handled in a timely manner
* Updating a Scrum Task board and burndown chart so that the information is up-to-date and can be relied on
* Skill and knowledge sharing

### Final Day

#### Sprint Review

If a team has collaborated efficiently, they’ll have worked together to meet the Sprint Goal, managing any risks and adjusting their plans as necessary. They’ll have demonstrated control throughout the Sprint through an even burndown of work remaining, where each member saw it as their personal responsibility to help complete work in progress. They’ll have a valuable increment to demonstrate to the Product Owner and any invited stakeholders. A Review is something a team should look forward to.  

It’s also something a team must prepare for. Enough time must be allowed for a demonstration of the work which has been performed. Tasks may be planned on a Sprint Backlog for this purpose, to make sure that the Review does justice to the work done and the value which is now available. Also, if the Product Owner thinks it would be a good idea to invite stakeholders, then those invitations ought to have been sent. The review is an opportunity to celebrate the work which has been done and to showcase their accomplishments, so confidence is inspired and a continued investment in the team might be justified.  

A Sprint Review is also an inspect-and-adapt opportunity. It’s a good time for the Product Owner to explain how well the product is performing, to get feedback first-hand from any invited parties, and to draw any lessons which might be used to improve the Product Backlog further. If any work has not been completed, for whatever reason, then this will also be reviewed and re-estimated on the Product Backlog for possible planning into future sprints.  

#### Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Review looked at the Product and the value delivered, at the work which has been done, and honestly and candidly at any work which wasn’t done, whatever the reason.  

The next thing to do is to conduct a Sprint Retrospective. A Retrospective considers the process which the team is following. Are they working as effectively as they can? It’s generally best to hold the Retrospective immediately after the Review, because the former can introduce ideas for consideration in the latter.  

The whole Development Team, the Product Owner, and the Scrum Master must all attend the Retrospective, because everyone is jointly responsible for the success of the team’s work. It’s really important to have a free and open session which gets to the heart of any problems and identifies actions which will help to resolve them. A Retrospective may begin with the following declaration:  

*“Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”*

In a “Retro”, everyone has an equal voice. One approach, which the Scrum Master may facilitate, is to identify:  

* Things which went well
* Things which didn’t go so well
* Ideas for improvement
* Shout-outs for team members who did something exceptional

Establishing a time-line can help jog attendees’ memories about significant events during the Sprint.
