This session I'd like you to focus on getting your group organised and prepared for the assessment project work. There are some things I'd like you to get setup, some organising prep work and some initial concept planning.

## Project Setup

### 1. Repl.it Team

Log in to Repl.it. At the bottom of the menu bar on the left you'll see "Teams BETA" link. **One** of your team should click on that link then click on the "Create a team" button to create a Repl.it team for your group. Either manually invite everyone in your team and me (andyguest on Repl.it) or pass out the invite link to the team (and me).   

Please pick a sensible name for your group, certainly nothing offensive!  

Any Repls you create within the Team are automatically accessible to the rest of the team and can be "multiplayered", multiple people can work on the repl at the same time. Alternatively you can work using separate repls within the account and bring the code together as components get completed.  

There is also a messenger type communicator built in to Repl.it.  

### 2. Team GitHub

One of your team should set up a GitHub account for the team. Make sure everyone in the team (and me) knows the GitHub account name. You can then link the repls you create directly to GitHub within Repl.it to have version/source control. (I'm not sure but you may need to ensure everyone knows the password to the GitHub or, once the repl.it GitHub link has been set up it may remember it).  

The GitHub/Repl.it linking will also mean if you want to work on your computer using a different IDE you should be able to clone the code from GitHub and do so. *If anyone in your team chooses to do this then everyone in your team **must** ensure they pull from GitHub before working and push back to it after it*. And please ensure the commit messages are meaningful, and include date/time and who made the changes.  

### 3. Team Communication Channel

One of your team should set up some way for your team to communicate. I don't mind how you do this so long as everybody knows what it is and has access to it (and so long as you invite me!). I suspect Discord will be the popular choice.  

### 4. Trello Account

Every member of the team should register for a Trello account at [www.trello.com](https://trello.com/en). You should be able to sign in using your University/Microsoft account.  

One member of your team should set up a team Task Board and invite everyone in the group to join it. Once again please invite me (a.guest@yorksj.ac.uk).  

### 5. Other Tools

You are of course, free to set up any other tools/accounts you feel may be useful. Again make sure you invite everyone in the team (and me) to any group tools/accounts you decide to use.  

## Project Planning

You will be managing this project using Agile Scrum Methodology. This means the work will be done in *sprints*. Please put together a schedule for your sprints.

For your initial schedule I recommend doing one sprint a week, starting and ending during your class session. Draw up a simple calendar of sprints from now till the submission date. (You can plan in time off over Xmas/New Year if you like :-). For each sprint identify and record who will be the Sprint Master. Remember you each have to be Sprint Master at least once.  

## Initial Concept Planning

Your first "sprint" runs from today to this time next week.  

Your tasks for this sprint are :-  
* decide on the game you'd like to make
* put together a brief description of the game. Screenshots of similar games to illustrate concepts would be helpful.
* put together a list of features that need to be implemented to make the game / user stories
* create a Product Backlog in Trello based on these features.
* prioritise the list by importance - remember importance is based on what needs to be done first as well as importance to the game
