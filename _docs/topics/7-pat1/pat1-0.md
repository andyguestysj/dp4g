The following pages are adapted from content from [www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com](www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com), to give an overview of different Design Patterns.  Any "I" references are the authors not mine.

They each follow the same structure.  

* **Intent** - A brief description of what the pattern does
* **Motivation** - A description of the issue the pattern addresses
* **The Pattern** - Pattern Description
* **When To Use It**
* **Keep In Mind**
* **Sample Code**
* **Design Decisions**
