#### Exercise 1 

1. Clone the repository [https://replit.com/@andyguest/pyFirstClass](https://replit.com/@andyguest/pyFirstClass) and open it.
2. Work your way through the tasks in the code - they are in the comments

#### Exercise 2
1. Return to pyFirstClass
2. Override the addition operator on the `Dog` class so that you can create a new dog object with the code below
```python
fred = Dog("Fred",5)
wilma = Dog("Wilma",4)
pebbles = fred + wilma
```
The new dog's name should be set to "Child of Fred and Wilma" and its age should be set to 0.
