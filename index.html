        <h1>Design Patterns</h1>
        <p>Design Patterns are well developed solutions to commonly occuring situations in object oriented programming 
            and design.

              <p class="lead">Creating good object oriented software is a challenge right from the start. We need to be
                   thinking object-oriented from the moment we start to think about software. Your analysis of the problem domain, 
                   your initial thoughts on game design, this is where a good object oriented approach begins.
              </p>
                <p class="lead">Design Patterns are tried and tested solutions to code that needs to be designed and problems that 
                    need to be solved. A good Design Pattern describes the problem it is applicable to, describes a solution to that 
                    problem, gives a code based example, describes potential problems with that solution and suggests alternatives 
                    that may be more appropriate.

            <h3 class="text-center">Python</h3>
            <p>You will be coding using Python. Python is a very popular programming language. It is very similar to Java. 
                You will be given a short introduction to Python but this module focuses on Design Patterns.

            <h3 class="text-center">OO Analysis & Design</h3>
            <p>Design Patterns are most effective when they are used from the start of a project. You will learn how to take Design 
                Patterns in to account when you are analysing problem domains and designing software.
